Soldiers and workers are about 5 to 6 feet long, while queens can grow to a length of 9 feet. Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them. Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair.<br><br> Giant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets.\n",

A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.<br><br>An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.<br><br>A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor. Assassin vine berries make a heady wine.<br><br>A subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of thermal energy. These plants have thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through with silver, brown, and white veins so that they resemble mineral deposits. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.<br><br>\n",

A basilisk usually has a dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly. Some specimens sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult basilisk’s body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its tail, which can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The creature weighs about 300 pounds.<br><br> Any living creature which meets the gaze of the basilisk must save vs Petrification or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs Petrification or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its reflection.\n",

In its natural form, the creature looks more or less humanoid, but slender and frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed features. The flesh is pale and hairless. Its large, bulging eyes are yellow with slitted pupils. A doppleganger is hardy, with a natural agility not in keeping with its frail appearance. In its natural form a doppleganger is about 5½ feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.<br><br>Dopplegangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society. Although not usually evil, they are interested only in themselves and regard all others as playthings to be manipulated and deceived.<br><br>When in its natural form, a doppleganger strikes with its powerful fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other armed person, it attacks with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such cases, it uses its mind reading power to employ the same tactics and strategies as the person it is impersonating.<br><br> Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish “true” dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven “age categories,” ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.<br><br>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.<br><br>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).<br><br>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.<br><br>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.<br><br>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a “normal” shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three shapes.<br><br>The shapes are:<br><br>Cone Shaped: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).<br><br>Line Shaped: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.<br><br>Cloud Shaped: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.<br><br>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of “talking;” this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for “talking” is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.<br><br>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.<br><br>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure. It's pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would have about double the given amount, while one of the next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).\n",

They have yellow skin dappled with light green patches, spots, or sometimes thin stripes. The color dulls and darkens with age until it reaches an almost uniform tan color at the oldest age category. They have long sinuous bodies and unusually long legs, giving them the fastest land movement rate of any dragon, but they are also accomplished fliers, as fast and maneuverable as any dragon. Plains dragons may hunt on the wing, attacking suddenly from above and surprising on 1-3 on 1d6; or, they may lie in wait in tall grass or a copse of trees, using their coloration as camouflage. As one ages and its colors dull, this ability improves; when lying in wait, they gain surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 at age categories 2 and 3, on 1-4 in age categories 4 through 6, and on 1-5 at age category 7. The breath weapon of the plains dragon is a scorching, shimmering cone of heat, barely visible to the naked eye; at night, however, a glow like steel being forged can be seen streaming from the dragon's open mouth.\n",

In an indoor environment or when underground, a cloud dragon appears to be a bright metallic color, while outdoors their coloration is brighter and less metallic, and may take on a reddish or bluish cast reminiscent of a sunrise or sunset. Hatchlings have a coppery skin tone, brightening to silver at the second age category, then to gold at the fourth before fading to a platinum tone by age category 6. While most true dragons become duller in color and sheen as they age, cloud dragons do not. Cloud dragons are not cruel and do not seek to kill for pleasure. Many tales are told of cloud dragons offering assistance to adventurers, though they are every bit as avaricious as any dragon; adventurers in need of gold need not bother asking for a loan. Another way in which cloud dragons differ from other types is that they do not have fixed breath weapons. Upon reaching the second age category, a cloud dragon acquires the breath weapon of a randomly-chosen (or GM assigned) dragon type; upon reaching the fourth age category, they acquire a second breath weapon type. Cloud dragons possess the same immunities as the dragons whose breath weapons they reproduce. All cloud dragons have the power to assume the form of any type of humanoid (as described in the spell charm person) at will in a manner otherwise equivalent to the spell polymorph self.\n",

When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog. Black dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect valuable items.<br><br>Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).<br><br>Black dragons are immune to all forms of acid.

Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed, waiting until opponents come within 100 feet to spring out and attack (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).<br><br>Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems, especially sapphires. Blue dragons are evil monsters, though not so fierce as red dragons. They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a blue dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person as a cat plays with a mouse.<br><br>Blue dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only half damage from magical lightning.\n",

A kobold is 2 to 2½ feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas. They aim to drive enemies into the traps, where other kobolds wait to pour flaming oil over them, shoot them, or drop poisonous vermin onto them. Kobolds have Darkvision with a range of 60', and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of light spells. Kobolds typically wear leather armor in battle.<br><br>One out of every six kobolds will be a warrior of 1 Hit Dice (25 XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP) with an Armor Class of 14 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP) who wears chain mail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 10', and who has a +1 bonus to damage. In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check as long as the kobold king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular kobold statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.<br><br>Kobolds are cunning foes. They see all larger races as enemies, and are thus likely to be hostile when encountered. However, they are naturally cowardly, and prefer to avoid combat, leading enemies into ambushes or traps rather than facing them directly. Sometimes kobold tribes build and inhabit extensive dungeon areas filled with deadly traps which only they know how to avoid.\n",

The gaze of a medusa will petrify any creature who meets it unless a save vs Petrification is made. In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC. It is safe to view a medusa's reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs Petrification itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.<br><br>Further, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save vs Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not individually, once per round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).<br><br>A medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a human.<br><br> Medusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that, once the lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will not rest until she is slain. They are hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many humans as they can without being discovered.\n",

Also called “sirens,” mermaids often attempt to lure sailors or other men found near the sea. They accomplish this by means of their enchanting songs.<br><br>A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect must save vs Spells to resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid's temperament.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.<br><br>Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.<br><br>Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother. Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is called a pod.<br><br>One-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids usually remain with a fertile sister (or more rarely a close friend) to help her ensnare men. This explains the first number appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be infertile.<br><br>A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet mermaids only in groups of 1 or 2.<br><br>Mermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and about 3% have some Clerical abilities.\n",

Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet. A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. Like most birds, the males have the brighter plumage, with females being duller in color and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be hidden, that is).<br><br>A light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope to ride upon a normal roc. For a large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1200. Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to 6000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off full-grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous birds.<br><br>A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results in that creature being carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to be as “fresh” as possible when given to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary). A solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack any man-sized or larger creature that appears edible. A mated pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend their nests or hatchlings.\n",

They often embrace finery and decadence and may assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance, vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors. They speak any languages they knew in life.<br><br>A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs Spells is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of the charm. This charm is so powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by the vampire.<br><br>The bite inflicts 1d3 damage, then each round thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire regenerates a 1d6 hit points (if needed) for each energy level drained. If the victim dies from the energy drain, he or she will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later). Vampires spawned in this way are under the permanent control of the vampire who created them.<br><br>If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons, and a vampire will generally choose to use a melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than attempting to bite.<br><br>Vampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all undead are immune to sleep, charm and hold spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.<br><br>Vampires command the lesser creatures of the night and once per day can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such creatures are nearby). These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.<br><br>A vampire can assume the form of a giant bator a dire wolf at will, requiring one round to complete the transformation. The flying movement listed is for the giant bat form. In animal form, the vampire can use the normal attacks for that form. It can't use its other powers while in animal form, except that creatures summoned are still controlled, and charms already in effect continue in effect.<br><br>For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses:<br><br>Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things don’t harm the vampire – they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for the rest of the encounter.<br><br>Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship. They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all.<br><br>Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it, as described above. However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can act for only one round and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a vampire’s heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed, by water or sunlight as described above, or by burning it completely in a funeral pyre.\n",

Compared to a larger horse, a pony may have a thicker coat, mane and tail, with proportionally shorter legs, a wider barrel, heavier bone, a thicker neck and a shorter, broader head. Ponies can be trained for war, and the morale in parentheses above is for a war pony; this does not allow them to fight while a rider is mounted, however. A light load for a pony is up to 275 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.\n",
