Reversed, haste becomes slow; affected creatures move at half speed, attacking half as often (generally, every other round) and making half a normal move each round. Naturally, target creatures may save vs Spells to avoid the effect. Haste and slow counter and dispel each other. ",

Otherwise, the host's spirit departs, and the caster's spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. Dispel evil can still be used to drive the caster's spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell.

Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the caster's command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 60 feet away.

Note that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster; for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able to see something the caster can't directly see, the caster does not see it. Also, all spell ranges are still figured from the caster's actual position, not the illusory self's position. ",

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of \"evil\" is left to the individual GM to decide. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are \"evil\" or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions in all ways as described above, save that \"good\" creatures are kept away, rather than \"evil\" creatures. ",

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work. Roll on the following table to determine what sort of creature the character becomes. Since the dead character is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the character's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the character's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated. A reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character's ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.) The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total from the character's original hit point total; this is the new form's hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. A character that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age. The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form.

The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a creature's save vs Spells prevents items in its possession from being teleported. The caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table below. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: \"Very familiar\" is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. \"Studied carefully\" is a place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one hour. \"Seen casually\" is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic. \"False destination\" is a place that does not truly exist or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80. On Target: The caster appears exactly where desired. Off Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead. Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster have gotten \"scrambled.\" Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time \"Mishap\" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll. ",

If the caster so desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the ground. The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halved the area. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick.

The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13 Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or several creatures can work together to do so.

The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won't cause the attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected area will. Anyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a save vs Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again. If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move or perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however.
